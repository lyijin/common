# Jellyfish all-in-one script, simplifiying the entire Jellyfish pipeline:
# 1. jellyfish count
# 2. jellyfish stats
# 3. jellyfish dump
#
# Two arguments needed: first one is k-mer size; second one is FASTA/FASTQ file.
# (note that -C collapses any k-mer with its complementary, use this if the 
# library is non-directional)
#
# NOTE: jellyfish merge not needed in Jellyfish v2 - merging is done whenever
# needed by jellyfish count.

set -e		# script exits upon a command producing nonzero exit value
